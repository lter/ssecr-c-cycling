# Carbon Cycling Responses Across Spatiotemporal Scales

This working group is part of the [LTER's](https://lternet.edu/) [Synthesis Skills for Early Career Researchers](https://lter.github.io/ssecr/) course

### Research questions
How does carbon cycling respond to environmental change (in experimental manipulations and to natural disturbances) and how does the duration of the disturbance influence how we model carbon cycling projections in the future across ecosystems? Further, what are the mechanisms driving these responses?

### Motivation
Experimental manipulations are utilized in many ecological studies to understand how ecosystems respond to disturbances across a variety of scales. These manipulations are designed to mimic future environmental changes, and their results are generally interpreted in the context of how these ecosystems would respond to said changes. We are interested in how relevant the duration of these experiments are to their applicability.

### Approach
We will compile data on carbon stocks, carbon fluxes, and productivity across LTER sites and beyond that implement different experimental manipulations (e.g. warming, nutrients additions, etc.).
